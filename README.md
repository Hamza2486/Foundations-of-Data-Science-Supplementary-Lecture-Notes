# Foundations of Data Science: From Statistics to Machine Learning

This repository contains a series of lecture-style slides I developed and used to teach recitation sections for **Principles of Data Science II (DS-UA 112)** at NYU.

The materials cover foundational topics in:

- **Probability Theory**
- **Descriptive Statistics**
- **Hypothesis Testing**
- **Statistical Significance**
- **Regression and Experimental Design**
- **Machine Learning** (including classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction)

Each PDF is designed to be visual, clear, and pedagogically grounded for students encountering these concepts for the first time.

## Acknowledgements

I am grateful to **Dr. Pascal Wallisch** for several examples and illustrations included throughout these slides. Additionally, my approach to probability theory and statistics was greatly inspired by **Dr. Carlos Fernandez-Granda**, who published a [Probability and Statistics for Data Science](https://www.ps4ds.net/) book accompanied with over 100 high-quality video lectures slides.
