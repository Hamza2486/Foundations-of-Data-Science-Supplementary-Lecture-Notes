# A Course in Principles of Data Science: Foundations of Statistics and Machine Learning

This repository contains a series of lecture-style slides I developed and used to teach recitation sections for **Principles of Data Science II (DS-UA 112)** at NYU.

The materials cover foundational topics in:

- **Probability Theory**
- **Descriptive Statistics**
- **Hypothesis Testing**
- **Statistical Significance**
- **Regression and Experimental Design**
- **Machine Learning** (including classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction)

Each PDF is designed to be visual, clear, and pedagogically grounded for students encountering these concepts for the first time.
